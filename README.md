### Running the React Version

- Open the integrated terminal in your code editor and install the project dependencies:

      npm install

- Once done with the installation, run the development server in your terminal.

      npm run dev

- You should see the notification `Your application running on port 5173 is available.` at the bottom of your editor.
- If using VS Code, click the `Open in Browser` button.
